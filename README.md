This reposetory contains just simple application, that works with pixebal API and show images.
Making this application I've learnt:
* to work with props, state;
* to organize data flow from child to parent;
* to make AJAX request in React

*As for styling of this app, I've used bootstrap framework and created pretty simple layout*
